# Order-Fulfillment-Dashboard
This project focused on analyzing and optimizing delivery logistics performance using comprehensive operational data. Utilizing Excel, the initiative involved consolidating disparate datasets, including customer feedback, order quantities, pricing, and delay metrics, to create a dynamic performance dashboard.

Key objectives included identifying critical drivers of delivery delays, evaluating route and city-specific inefficiencies, and assessing the impact of vehicle and driver performance on overall delivery times. A significant outcome was the identification of peak delay hours, specific high-delay routes and cities, and the discovery that "expedited" order rules paradoxically led to increased delays. The analysis also provided crucial insights into customer sentiment, highlighting areas for targeted improvement in customer satisfaction. This project provides actionable intelligence to enhance delivery efficiency and improve the overall customer experience.
